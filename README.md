# Lazy Loading Modules

In this code example, we worked with the [Tour of Heroes](https://angular.io/guide/http) project, and made the following modifications:

- [ ] Consolidated the dependencies for the `/dashboard` route into a `DashboardModule`
- [ ] Consoidated the dependencies for the `/heroes` route into a `HeroesModule`
- [ ] Converted the `DashboardModule` into a lazy loaded module

## For Next Time...

We will deep dive into the following Libraries / Features of Angular at scale:

- [ ] Routing and Navigation
- [ ] Observables & RxJS
- [ ] Dependency Injection

## Bonus Round...

- Configuring `Markdownlint`
- Configuring `TSLint`
- Fix `tslint` codelyzer "custom rule directory" bug
