# Lazy Loading Modules

In this code example, we worked with the [Tour of Heroes](https://angular.io/guide/http) project, and made the following modifications:

- [ ] Consolidated the dependencies for the `/dashboard` route into a `DashboardModule`
- [ ] Consoidated the dependencies for the `/heroes` route into a `HeroesModule`
- [ ] Converted the `DashboardModule` into a lazy loaded module

## Future Topics

- [ ] Interceptors
- [ ] Guards
- [ ] Pipes
- [ ] Singleton Services
