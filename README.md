# Angular Examples

## Questions Asked

- **How can we implement component cacheing?** Review [this guide](https://angular.io/api/router/RouteReuseStrategy#shouldreuseroute) for documetation of a feature in the Angular API that can help with this (by comparing attributes of the current vs. future route)

## Lazy Loading Modules

In this code example, we worked with the [Tour of Heroes](https://angular.io/guide/http) project, and made the following modifications:

- [ ] Consolidated the dependencies for the `/dashboard` route into a `DashboardModule`
- [ ] Consoidated the dependencies for the `/heroes` route into a `HeroesModule`
- [ ] Converted the `DashboardModule` into a lazy loaded module

## For Next Time...

We will deep dive into the following Libraries / Features of Angular at scale:

- [ ] Routing and Navigation
- [ ] Observables & RxJS << The next thing we will work on
- [ ] Dependency Injection

## Future Topics

- [ ] Interceptors
- [ ] Guards
- [ ] Pipes
- [ ] Singleton Services

## Bonus Round...

- Configuring `Markdownlint`
- Configuring `TSLint`
- Fix `tslint` codelyzer "custom rule directory" bug
